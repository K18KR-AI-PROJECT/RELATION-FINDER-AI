# The software works on Python and make use of logpy and nltk modules to complete the given task
# The software is made by the most hard-working student of section K18KR which are - Akash, Daman, Harshit and Kapil.
# The project is completed during the lockdown and hence it can be concluded that the project is made through sheer will power and outstanding hardwork
# The groupmates made use of their extreme skills to complete the project and are in hope that their efforts will bear fruit and they will get high scores in the assignment. Since, the group comprise of student that have low marks in CA-1 and since theie CA-2 is not evaluated, they are too cautious about their marks in this assignment.
# This condition and the present situation (spread of coronavirus) makes the marks awarded ,for the assignment, a very sensitive topic and hence if the students are discriminated (based on personal biasis or past experiences) in  any way, there will be riots among the masses and there will be far worse consequences for the deed.
# Student can take extreme measures to achieve their goals and hence, if theie efforts are not paid off, they will not sit quiet
# At last, the whole scenario can be changed if marks awarded are high........
# kind regards - Akash, Kapil, Harshit, Daman.
